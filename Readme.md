# Virtual Private Server (VPS)

This project contains everything that concerns my VPS.

## Getting started

Copy `group_vars/all.yml` to `vars.yml`. At least fill in the variables that are commented out. As these almost certainly contain sensitive information, use ansible-vault to encrypt and edit the file.
